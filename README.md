docker-pihole
========

This project runs [Pihole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) and [cloudflared](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-cloudflared) as docker containers.

- **The Pi-hole**[¬Æ](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/) is a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Sinkhole) that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

- **Cloudflared** an [Argo Tunnel client](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) proxy-dns Docker image who runs an [argo-tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel)

- **DNS-Over-HTTPS** is a protocol for performing DNS lookups securly via HTTPS. (If you are not aware of what DNS is, please read this [primer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-tls/) before continuing).



## Update system packages
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Disable swapping
Take care of the SD card :rocket:
```bash
sudo swapoff --all
```

## Log2ram
Usefull for RaspberryPi for not writing on the SD card all the time. You need it because your SD card doesn't want to suffer anymore! See [log2ram](https://github.com/azlux/log2ram) project for more information.

```bash
echo "deb http://packages.azlux.fr/debian/ buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azlux.list
wget -qO - https://azlux.fr/repo.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install log2ram
```

Modify /etc/log2ram.conf
```
SIZE=128M
```


You can now check the mount folder in ram with (You will see lines with log2ram if working) - Reboot your RaspberryPi to active the changes..
```
# df -h
‚Ä¶
log2ram         128M   34M   95M  27% /var/log
‚Ä¶

# mount
‚Ä¶
log2ram on /var/log type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=131072k,mode=755)
‚Ä¶
```

## Install docker
See https://github.com/docker/docker-install üê≥ for more information
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

### Install required packages
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libffi-dev
```

### Install Docker Compose from pip (using Python3)
This might take a while

```bash
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
```

## Install Portainer
If you are running Linux, deploying Portainer is as simple as:

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 --name portainer --restart always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer
```
Voil√†, you can now use Portainer by accessing the port 9000 on the server where Portainer is running. See [Portainer Project](https://portainer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html) for more information.

## Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunnerklaus/docker-pihole.git ~/docker-pihole
cd ~/docker-pihole
```

## Quick Start
Run Pihole standalone
[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) example:

```yaml
version: "3"

# More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/ and https://docs.pi-hole.net/
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
      - "443:443/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Vienna
      # WEBPASSWORD: 'set a secure password here or it will be random'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
       - etc:/etc/pihole/
       - dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d/
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1
      - 1.1.1.1
    # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Before starting edit the docker-compose file and set
```yml
TZ: Europe/Vienna
WEBPASSWORD: 'changeme'
```
to your need.

## Usage

Docker compose is the recommended way to run this image. You can use the following docker-compose file, then run all containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

You can access pihole on the server where it runs on port 80.

## Upgrade

To upgrade, pull the newer image and launch the container:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```


## Check cloudflared
```bash
docker exec cloudflared cloudflared --version
```
